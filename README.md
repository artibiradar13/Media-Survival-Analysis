📊 Bharat Herald Newspaper – Digital Transformation Case Study
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the decline of Bharat Herald, a 70+ year-old legacy newspaper with operations across five Indian states. Between 2019–2024, the company faced:

📉 A 21% drop in circulation (39.7M → 31.3M copies).

🚫 A failed e-paper pilot (55% engagement vs 68% readiness).

💰 Heavy reliance on government ads (75% of revenue), leading to advertiser churn.

❌ Bureau closures, layoffs, and declining investor confidence.

As a data analyst (role-play: Peter Pandey), the goal was to quantify the decline, identify recovery opportunities, and design a digital-first roadmap for sustainable growth.
